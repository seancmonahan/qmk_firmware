# Spaceshift - space keys are now shift when held!
Inspired by my use of Spacefn, I wanted to retain symmetric access to shift keys on both hands. I found that my thumbs naturally rested one key 

# TODO
- [ ] Macro enable LEDs
- [ ] Macro enable layers
- [ ] Macro toggle shift/space,lower,raise,shift/space and lower,shift/space,shift/space,raise
- [ ] Macro rotary encoder usage?
- [ ] Test if arm_rgb is correctly merged into master (tap/timer functions are broken in arm_rgb's head at the moment)
- [ ] Toggle for Colemak / Colemak Mod DH
- [ ] vim keys for navigation somehow
- [ ] numpad keys
- [ ] GUI lockout
- [ ] game mode? (remap left side keys to more traditional spots)
